These Terms of Use govern your use of the Services, which includes your use of the Platform through which you may make such an offer to a Supplier. However, the provision of the Product you Book will be subject to the terms and conditions displayed on the Website in respect of such Product, any information made available to you during the Booking process, and the terms and conditions of the Supplier with whom you have a legal contract for the supply of the Product.</Typography>

Your interactions with Suppliers are at your own risk.
